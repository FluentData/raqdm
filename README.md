access data from EPA's Air Quality Datamart in R

This branch is a reboot of this project trying to incorporate some of the things I've learned about programming over the last year. Suggestions/feature requests are welcome!

You can install with `devtools`:

```R
  devtools::install_github("ebailey78/raqdm", ref = "update")
```

You will need a username and password from EPA to access the actual data. You can visit the [Air Quality Data Mart](http://www.epa.gov/airdata/tas_Data_Mart_Registration.html) for information on registering. It's free!
